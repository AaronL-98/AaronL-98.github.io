# Implementing the Devlog Feature
**Date**: November 6, 2024

## Summary
Set up the devlog page to feature regular updates. Posts are stored as individual Markdown files for easy management and organized chronologically to track project progress.

## Key Highlights
- **Devlog Page Structure**: The left column displays the current project and lists recent devlog posts in ascending order by date.
- **Markdown Integration**: Each devlog entry is created in Markdown, keeping it easy to edit and version-controlled through GitHub.
- **Overlay for Projects**: The central column contains clickable project entries that display an overlay with project details and associated devlog entries.

## Next Steps
- Begin adding content to the devlog.
- Implement a toggle function to switch between current and past projects.
