# Creating a Responsive Layout and Color Scheme
**Date**: November 5, 2024

## Summary
Developed a responsive layout with a three-row structure(Head, Body, Foot) and three-columb(Left, Middle, Right) that adjusts for screen sizes. Implemented a dark color scheme with a black/dark grey base and white text, adding a purple border for button hover effects.

## Key Highlights
- **Header-Body-Footer Structure**: Established a clean layout with a header for navigation, a body with three responsive columns, and a footer.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS was used to ensure content wraps and adjusts dynamically for different screen sizes.
- **Color Scheme**: A dark theme with purple accents creates a modern and professional look.

## Next Steps
- Add individual stylesheets for each page, inheriting global styles to allow for specific adjustments.
- Start developing the devlog page and structure for posts.
