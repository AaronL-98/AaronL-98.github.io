# Layout and Color Scheme
**Date**: September 25, 2024

## Summary
I implemented a three-column layout for certain pages (especially the devlog) and finalized a dark color scheme with purple accents.

## Key Highlights
- **Color Palette**: Black/dark gray background, white text, and purple (`#bb86fc`) hover effects.
- **Three-Column Structure**: Devlog page now has a left column (for current project highlights), a central column (for project lists or devlog links), and room for an optional right column.
- **Global Styles**: Created a `global.css` file to house universal styles, ensuring each page maintains a cohesive look.

## Next Steps
- Introduce a Markdown-based devlog system to simplify posting updates.
- Investigate using Jekyll to manage content and generate pages automatically.
