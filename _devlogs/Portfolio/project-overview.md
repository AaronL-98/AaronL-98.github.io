# Portfolio Project Overview

The **Portfolio Project** is a web-based portfolio designed to showcase skills in **Development and Testing** using GitHub Pages. The portfolio includes an organized file structure to manage content effectively as it scales and incorporates a devlog page for ongoing updates. The project features responsive styling, a dark-themed color scheme, and specific pages for project showcases, contact information, and a developer log (devlog) to document the development journey and future updates.

## Project Objectives

- **Clear and Scalable Structure**: Ensuring the root folder remains organized by using a structured directory system for content, stylesheets, scripts, and testing frameworks.
- **Responsive Layout**: A mobile-friendly design with three main columns, centralized content, and hover effects for an engaging user experience.
- **Devlog Integration**: Regular Markdown-based devlog posts to track project updates and display progress, allowing visitors to explore current and past projects.

## Key Components

- **File Organization**: 
  - Organized with `src/` for main website files, `devlog/` for Markdown entries, and `tests/` for separate web and API testing frameworks.
  - Assets (images, videos, etc.) are in `src/assets/`, while CSS and JavaScript files are in `src/styles/` and `src/scripts/`, respectively.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Implemented a header-body-footer layout, with a central column and left column for devlog highlights.
  - Dark color scheme with purple hover effects on buttons for a modern look.

- **Testing Frameworks**:
  - Separate directories for web and API testing scripts, configurations, and utility functions to streamline test management.

## Devlog Page

The **Devlog Page** is structured to display updates on current and past projects. The left column features the current project and a chronological list of devlog posts. The central column includes a clickable list of projects, with each entry displaying an overlay of details and devlog entries for that project.

## Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Organized the file structure and created main HTML files for `index`, `projects`, `contact`, and `devlog`.
2. **Responsive Layout & Styling**: Applied CSS for a responsive, dark-themed design with hover effects.
3. **Devlog Creation**: Set up the devlog page to display project updates in Markdown format for easy management and integration.
4. **Testing Frameworks**: Added web and API testing directories to ensure site stability and allow for future expansion.
5. **Deployment**: Deployed the site on GitHub Pages, tested each page, and confirmed that the site was live.

With this project, I aim to provide a professional, organized display of my development skills and document ongoing work on various projects in the devlog.
