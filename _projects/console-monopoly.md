## Overview
Console Monopoly is a text-based simulation of the classic Monopoly board game, designed and implemented in **C++** as part of my second-year university coursework.

## Features
- Turn-based gameplay supporting multiple players.
- Property management, including buying and selling.
- Randomized dice rolls and movement across the board.
- Dynamic in-game transactions and balance updates.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for game logic and object-oriented programming.
- **File Handling**: Used for saving and loading game state.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented player actions, game board, and property management.

## Lessons Learned
- Improved **object-oriented programming** skills in C++.
- Gained experience in **handling game states** and implementing **file I/O**.
- Learned how to structure a **modular codebase** for better scalability.
