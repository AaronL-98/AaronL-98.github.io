## Overview
Console Monopoly is a text-based simulation of the classic Monopoly board game, designed and implemented in **C++** as part of my second-year university coursework.

## Features
- Implement Monopoly game rules.
- Player management including buying, selling, and trading properties.
- Bank management including handling player transactions.
- Dice rolling mechanism.
- Property management including houses and hotels.
- Save and load game functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for game logic and object-oriented programming.
- **File Handling**: Used for saving and loading game state.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented player actions, game board, and property management.

## Persal Achievements
- Improved **object-oriented programming** skills in C++.
- Gained experience in **handling game states** and implementing **file I/O**.
- Learned how to structure a **modular codebase** for better scalability.

## Conclusion
The "Console Monopoly" project showcases your proficiency in C++ and your ability to implement complex game mechanics. It demonstrates skills in object-oriented programming, game development, and software design.
