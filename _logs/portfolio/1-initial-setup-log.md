## Summary
Today, I set up the basic structure for my portfolio, including essential HTML files and a GitHub Pages configuration.

## Key Highlights
- **Creation**: Created GitHub repository and configured GitHub Pages.
- **Development Goals**: Get started, begin building my portfolio, and research best ways to highlight my skillset.

## Next Steps
- Begin creating the main pages: `index`, `projects`, and `contact`.
- Start designing the color scheme and layout for a cohesive look and feel.
