# Adding the Devlog Feature
**Date**: October 1, 2024

## Summary
I created a dedicated devlog page where updates are listed in ascending order. The structure allows me to write devlog entries in Markdown, so I can focus on content rather than manual HTML edits.

## Key Highlights
- **Devlog Page**: Set up a page that displays new posts for ongoing projects, enabling quick project updates.
- **Markdown Integration**: Preliminary testing of writing devlog posts in `.md` files for faster updates.
- **Preview Branch**: Created a `dev` branch to test new changes before merging to `main`.

## Next Steps
- Transition to Jekyll for automated page generation, so each devlog entry can be a Markdown file in a `_devlogs/` folder.
- Add a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and preview changes in `dev`.
